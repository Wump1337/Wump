# Wump
Hello there, My name is James (a.k.a. Wump). My first ever project was called WebsterOS. It was an operating system based on Linux. We had released V1.1 and then we quit. I started a Discord Bot called Syntax before my account being flagged, I hadn't verified my phone and made a new account, there I continued Syntax until an idea struck me. **What if I recreated YouTube Shorts and TikTok?** I had my friend Lenny help me. It worked out until my mental health got worse and worse, I told Lenny to hold Clipper (the TikTok clone) for some time.

**I started a community server, hoping it would work. It was raided only 7 days of running it.**
Only 1 week ago I tried to recreate it and it surprisingly is almost just like my old server. 

I have many projects i'm managing right now, if anything intresting happens i'll list it :D
