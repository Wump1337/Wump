# Wump#1337
Hello there, My name is James (a.k.a. Wumpus or Wump). My first ever project was called WebsterOS. It was an operating system based on Linux. We had released V1.1 and then we quit. I started a Discord Bot called Syntax before my account being flagged, I hadn't verified my phone and made a new account, there I continued Syntax until an idea struck me. **What if I recreated YouTube Shorts and TikTok?** I had my friend Lenny help me. It worked out until my mental health got worse

**I started a community server, hoping it would work. It was raided only 7 days of running it.**

Here I am today managed multiple things at a time, hope you enjoyed the short story of me ^_^
