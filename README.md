# More About Me
I'm James (Jacques in French), I'm 14 years old, and turn 15 in April. I was born in **Quebec** (which explains why my primary language is French).

# My Goal
My goal is to change the future of websites and technology before I die. I also program in **4** different languages which makes my goal easier!

# Projects
You can view my projects on my GitHub page, I mostly have orginisations for my projects.

# Downsides
I suffer from a lot, in this case I'm discussing my depression. **It's the only thing that pushes me back from who I want to be.** You don't need to support me, donate to me, I always just help myself
